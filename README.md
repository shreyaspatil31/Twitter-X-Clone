# Twitter/X Clone

This is a simple clone of the Twitter/X user interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The project mimics the core layout of Twitter/X, including the sidebar with navigation options, a main feed area with posts, and user interactions such as comments, retweets, and likes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop.
- **Sidebar:** Contains links to sections such as Home, Explore, Notifications, and Profile.
- **Main Feed:** Displays a sample post, including image and interaction icons (comments, retweets, likes, and views).
- **Post Creation:** Simulates a simple post creation input area with a text box and action icons (image, GIF, poll, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling and layout.
- **Google Fonts - Material Symbols**: For the icons used in the sidebar and posts.

## Getting Started

### Tailwind CSS Setup

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. It enables you to use utility-first classes directly in your HTML to build the layout without writing custom CSS. Tailwind CSS has been added using the CDN version for ease of use.

To add Tailwind CSS to this project:

1. Link to the Tailwind CDN in your `index.html` file:
   ```html
   <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@3.0.0/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

2. Alternatively, if you want to use a local version or customize the Tailwind CSS, you can set up a full build environment by following these steps:

   **Installation via npm (optional):**

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss
   ```

   **Creating a Tailwind configuration:**

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

   **Configure `tailwind.config.js`** to enable customization, like extending themes, colors, etc.

   **Build Tailwind CSS:**

   After configuring Tailwind, you can run this command to generate a CSS file with only the utilities you need:
   
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/output.css
   ```

   **Link the built CSS in your `index.html`:**

   ```html
   <link href="css/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
   ```

### Customization

You can easily modify the content of the posts or add more sections. Edit the `index.html` file to update the layout and text. You can also adjust the Tailwind CSS configuration to match your design needs.

### Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:
- **Google Fonts (Material Symbols)**: For icons in the layout.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the page and making it responsive. The project is currently using the Tailwind CDN version for simplicity.
